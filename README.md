## GET_HOMOLOGUES: a versatile software package for pan-genome analysis

This software is written and maintained by Bruno Contreras-Moreira (bcontreras _at_ eead.csic.es) and Pablo Vinuesa (vinuesa _at_ ccg.unam.mx). The first version, **suitable for bacterial genomes**, was described in:

[Contreras-Moreira B, Vinuesa P (2013) Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 79:7696-7701](http://aem.asm.org/content/79/24/7696.long)

That code has been and is regularly patched (see CHANGES in each release), and has recently been adapted to the study of **intra-specific eukaryotic pangenomes**, which we have tested with whole-genome data and transcripts of plants.

We kindly ask you to report errors or bugs in the program to the authors and to acknowledge the use of the program in scientific publications.
