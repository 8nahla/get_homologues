## GET_HOMOLOGUES: a versatile software package for pan-genome analysis

This software is written and maintained by Bruno Contreras-Moreira (bcontreras _at_ eead.csic.es) and Pablo Vinuesa (vinuesa _at_ ccg.unam.mx). 
The first version, **suitable for bacterial genomes**, was described in:

[Contreras-Moreira B, Vinuesa P (2013) Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 79:7696-7701](http://aem.asm.org/content/79/24/7696.long)

and

[Vinuesa P, Contreras-Moreira B (2015) Methods in Molecular Biology Volume 1231, 203-232](http://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007%2F978-1-4939-1720-4_14)

The software has also been adapted to the study of **intra-specific eukaryotic pan-genomes**, as described in:

[Contreras-Moreira B, Cantalapiedra CP et al (2017) Front. Plant Sci. 10.3389/fpls.2017.00184](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpls.2017.00184/full)

We tested it with genomes and transcriptomes of *Arabidopsis thaliana* and *Hordeum vulgare*, available at [http://floresta.eead.csic.es/plant-pan-genomes](http://floresta.eead.csic.es/plant-pan-genomes).

The code is regularly patched (see [CHANGES.txt](./CHANGES.txt) in each release), and has been used in a variety of studies 
(see citing papers [here](https://scholar.google.es/scholar?start=0&hl=en&as_sdt=2005&cites=5259912818944685430)).

We kindly ask you to report errors or bugs in the program to the authors and to acknowledge the use of the program in scientific publications.
