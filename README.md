## GET_HOMOLOGUES: a versatile software package for pan-genome analysis

This software is written and maintained by Bruno Contreras-Moreira (bcontreras _at_ eead.csic.es) and Pablo Vinuesa (vinuesa _at_ ccg.unam.mx). A first version, suitable for analysis of bacterial genomes, was published in:

[Contreras-Moreira,B. and Vinuesa,P. (2013) GET_HOMOLOGUES, a versatile software package for scalable and robust microbial pangenome analysis. Appl.Environ.Microbiol. 79:7696-7701](http://aem.asm.org/content/79/24/7696.long)

That code has been patched over two years now (see CHANGES), and has recently been adapted to the study of intra-specific eukaryotic pangenomes. We have tested it with whole-genome data and transcripts of grasses.


We kindly ask you to report errors or bugs in the program to the authors and to acknowledge the use of the program in scientific publications.
